# SEEK_Job_Ads_Data_Scrapper
Python script to scrap job info from seek.com.au

Please start by running Data_Scraper.py.

The program will ask you to enter the job name or title you want to search.

After that, the program will also ask you the number of samples you want to include in this session.

Finally, it will output a json file which allows you to do further data visualisation later.

This is my first project. So let me know if there are any problems.
